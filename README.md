# In The Money

Proof of concept setup for programmatic American style options contracts using the Ethereum fungible token standard [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) as the underlying. Most of the work is in the unit tests that exercise a basic flow.

In the future iterations the option contract should be converted to the [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) non-fungible token standard.
